# ACME 6502 Breadboard Computer

## The Ultimate 8-Bit Learning Journey

**ACME 6502** is not just another breadboard computer - it's a comprehensive educational system that teaches computer architecture from the ground up. Our unique approach combines vintage computing with modern development methods.

### Revolutionary Features
- **FRAM-based address decoding** - Programmable hardware logic instead of fixed 74-series chips
- **Serial EEPROM mass storage** - IÂ²C-based file system for program storage
- **CLI-only development** - Authentic 1980s development experience on Raspberry Pi
- **Progressive learning path** - From basic electronics to complex computer architecture

### The Ultimate Vision
While ambitious, our goal is to build a 6502 system so advanced it could theoretically run a simplified UNIX-like operating system, featuring:
- Dynamic memory management with bank switching
- File system with serial EEPROM storage
- Multi-tasking capabilities through interrupt handling
- Hardware-accelerated graphics (with future expansion)
- Network connectivity via modern interfaces

### Learning Path
**Phase 1:** CLI & Electronics Foundation  
**Phase 2:** Arduino Control System  
**Phase 3:** 6502 Processor Integration  
**Phase 4:** FRAM Address Logic & Memory  
**Phase 5:** Advanced System Software  
**Phase 6:** Innovative Applications

### Why ACME 6502?
This project bridges eras - using contemporary tools to master vintage technology while implementing forward-thinking concepts like programmable hardware and software-defined architecture. You're not just building a computer; you're understanding the fundamental principles that power all modern computing systems.
